<h2>Welcome to The Barkery 116!:</h2>
    <p>Hello! We are a small business started by me, Isadora Jones. We make dog treats for your four legged friends, making sure we consider your four legged friend in every decision we make. We are a business mainly based on emailing as a way to receive orders so if you havea any questions or comments please email us at thebarkery116@gmail.com.</p>
<h2>What we sell!:</h2>
    <p> At The Barkery 116 we sell lots of flavors for treats, such as apple, carrot, banana, and pumpkin. Each of these flavors has a different perk as to why dogs like it. (Pumpkin is good for dogs digestive system, apple helps with dogs dental hygiene). We have a wonderful staff and 1 very happy taste tester. I hope you enjoy our product and will come back for more in the future! Also make sure to check out our other pages on this website for more information. Bone appetit!</p>
